    title: Biography
    summary: |
      I am a PhD candidate at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, UNSW, 
      majoring in Adversarial Machine Learning (related to AI). 
      I had already published (or be accepted) three papers during PhD studies. I earned two Master degrees 
      from UCD (Ireland, First Class Honor) and BJUT (China, Outstanding Graduate Student), 
      one in Computer Science and one in Engineering. My Bachelor's degree was got from BJUT in Engineering.

      My research interests are on Adversarial Machine Learning, especially on Image Retrieval Systems, 
      including both attack and defence algorithms. In addition, I also work on the connections between Database and AI.
